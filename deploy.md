We will be using MongoDb atlas to store the database on cloud to deploy purpose.


step 1:
    in this MongoDB atlas we will be making the user who will be only able to edit the project (we can edit the access too)
    username: virajyawale
    password: 680MC06VSje13Bz0

step 2:
    in this setup  we have to add the IP address of our machine but after it get online then the online cloud IP we have to add

step 3:
    to connect we get the url
    (mongodb+srv://virajyawale:680MC06VSje13Bz0@cluster0.4qyoh3q.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0)

    we have to change the mongo server link
    async function main() {
        await mongoose.connect('mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/wanderlust');
    }

    (NOTE: when we will open the project after replacing the link the the data of listing will be empty as it is not connect with the local system)

step 4:
    we will be using connect-mongo 
    (Why use connect-mongo?
    By default, express-session stores sessions in memory, which:

    ❌ Doesn't scale (lost on server restart)

    ❌ Is not shared across multiple servers (bad for production)

    ❌ Can lead to memory leaks over time)
    (Why Use connect-mongo in Deployment? -- chatGPT it!!!)

    using this the session which was get store in local system will be store in cloud (mongoDB atlas)

step 5: 
    using RENDER to deployment
        - for that we have to add "engines": {
                "node": "23.11.0"
            },in package.json to specify the version

    if we make the changes the we can deploy it with the option in deploy -- which will be easy

step 6: shift all the stuff which should not be deploy on github in .env file
        - secret
        (we don't have to deploy on github - .env & node_modules)
        steps-
            - git init  < convert the project to git project
            - touch .gitignore  < which will ingore the file which we do not want to uppload on repo
                .env
                node_modules/
                **/.DS_Store    (those three files we donot want to push in repo (DS_Store is only in macbook))
